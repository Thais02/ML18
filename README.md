Hi there!

If you're here to review our bot's code and view the tournament code used, you're in luck.

You can find our bot in the folder 'ourbbot' as 'ourbot.py'

We used a modified version of the tournament code, you'll find it as 'tournament_2.py'
From that file the seeds and methods used should be clearly visible.

The full output of the various experiments can be found in the 'experiments' folder.
